Project-May-2022
My project is about using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create front-end web delveopment for my website. 
CSS and JavaScript features I completed:
   * A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal styles, or is opened and closed by clicking the “hamburger” icon
   * Use Flexbox or CSS Grid to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. Simply applying a basic flex property so that text wraps as you change screen sizes does not count. You must actually rearrange content or perform some more advanced feature. For example, swapping from a single column layout to a two-column layout on a desktop.
   * Create one or more JavaScript objects (such as with multiple values contained in { }’s),     modify at least one value of that object, and display it on your site
   * Create a Javascript loop that dynamically displays HTML on your page - for example displaying a number of list items <li> based on how many times you loop

To see my project open the index.html file. To see CSS open the main.css file. And for JavaScript open the javascript.js.
