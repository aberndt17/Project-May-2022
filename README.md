# Project-May-2022
## I am using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create a website. Some of the features being used are the "hamburger" icon which allows the naviagtion menu to collapse or expand when being seen on a moblie or desktop, media queries to allow a user to see my website in a small, mediumn or large screen and CSS Grid using a 12 column layout.
To see my project open the index.html file. To see CSS open the main.css file. And for JavaScript open the javascript.js.
